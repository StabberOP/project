##R studio

##factors:
##i -factors are used to represent categorical fata.Factors can be unordered or orderd # nolint
##ii-one can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a label # nolint

##Data Frame
##1.Data frame is used to store tabular Data.
##2.data frame also have a special attribute called row.names.
##3.Data frame are usually created by callling read.tabl.e() or read.csv()
##4.Can be converted to matrix by calling data.matrix().
##5.They are represent as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length. # nolint
##6.Each element of the list can be thought of a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows. # nolint

##Example :
##for (Data)
dFrame<-data.frame(srNo=1:6,code=c('M','F','M','F')) # nolint


class(dFrame) ##class of dFrame.
nrow(dFrame) ##nummber of rows.
ncol(dFrame)##number of column.


##vectorized operation
x<-1:4 # nolint
y<-6:9 # nolint
x+y # nolint

Matrix
##matrix are vectors with dimension attribute
 thismatrix<-matrix(c(3,2,-1,1),nrow=2,ncol=2)
M<-matrix(nrow = 2,ncol = 3) # nolint
#binding
mat1<-bind(x,y)

sequences
>seq(5,25,by=3)
should have interval of 3 in between
repetation
rep(1:3,6)
1 for 6,3 also for 6 times
